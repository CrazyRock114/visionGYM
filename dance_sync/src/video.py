    OpenCV's VideoWriter emits MPEG-4 Part 2, which most players and every

    The rendered frames are silent by construction — OpenCV has no concept of an
    audio track, and the MP4 that went to the model was built with ``-an``
    because audio is dead weight in a base64 upload. So the audio has to come
    from *audio_from*, the original source, and this is the only place in the
    pipeline where the two are in the same command.

    Sync needs no correction: the render writes exactly one frame per decoded
    frame at the source's own rate, so both streams start at t=0 and run at the
    same speed. ``-shortest`` trims the tail — this clip's audio stream is 15 ms
    longer than its video, which is normal for a phone recording.

    *audio_codec* defaults to ``"copy"``: the source track is already AAC, and
    re-encoding a 48 kbps stream to hand a lossy copy to the muxer would only
    lose quality. Pass a real encoder (``"aac"``) for a source whose codec MP4
