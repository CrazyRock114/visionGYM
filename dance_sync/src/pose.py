    """Reduce the raw detections to one box per real subject, in place.

    The model reports ten track ids on a clip with three dancers. Seven distinct
    problems produce those extra seven, and each needs its own pass:

    1. **Poses on a blank frame** — the clip's last frame is fully black, and the
       model returns three poses for it: the detector finds nothing, the tracker
       predicts each box forward a step, and ViTPose runs on a crop of pure
       black. Every one of those poses is invented, so the frame is rejected
       whole rather than per subject. Which frames are blank is a question about
       pixels, so *src.video.blank_frames* answers it and passes the indices in.
    2. **Degenerate boxes** — non-positive width or height. Not a subject at all.
    3. **One track, two boxes in a frame** — a track id is an identity, so a
       frame listing the same id twice is a duplicate by definition, whatever
       the boxes look like. This is exact where geometry is a guess, so it runs
       first and catches 114 boxes here.
    4. **Boxes too small to be a person** — the two dancers who enter late each
       have a real track id whose *early* frames sit on background clutter, so a
       per-track verdict cannot reject them; the individual box has to go. This
       is an absolute floor, not a fraction of the track's own size: the centre
       dancer starts far from the camera at area 0.068 and walks in to 0.257, so
       "much smaller than usual for this track" is a description of that dancer,
       not of a ghost. The two populations are far apart — real detections start
       at 0.068, ghost boxes stop at 0.03 — so anything in that gap gives the
       same answer.
    5. **Frozen boxes** — a box byte-identical to the same track's box on the
       previous frame. That is a tracker coasting on a target it has lost, not a
       subject holding perfectly still: a real body's box changes every frame
       from pose noise alone, and across this clip's three dancers there is not
       one frozen pair (0 of 1653) against a 31-frame frozen run on the ghost.
    6. **Ghost tracks** — a box tracked on a background object, a shadow, or a
       dancer's own raised arm, for its whole life. Two properties separate them
       from people with wide margins on this clip, so both are required rather
       than either:

           track          lifetime   median area
           dancers        0.86-1.00  0.104-0.257
           ghosts        <=0.29     <=0.054

       Lifetime is the stronger signal — a dancer is on screen for seconds, a
       false positive flickers — and area rules out the arm ghosts that happen
       to persist. Note what is *not* used: aspect ratio looks tempting (ghost
       boxes are slivers) but a dancer mid-kick reaches w/h 1.2 while a ghost
       drops to 0.39, so the ranges overlap and it would cost real detections.
    7. **Near-identical boxes across two ids** — the tracker hands identity over
       by running the old and new track together for a few frames before the old
       one ages out, so one body briefly reports twice at IoU ~0.97.

    Deliberately absent: suppressing a small box that sits *inside* a larger one.
    It reads as the obvious fix for arm ghosts, and it costs 183 real frames of
    the right-hand dancer, whose box is often mostly covered by the center
    dancer's much larger one.

    Each surviving person also gets a ``slot``: its subject's rank in order of
    first appearance, 0, 1, 2. That is what the overlay colors by — track ids
    are arbitrary (this clip keeps 0, 1 and 4), and indexing a palette with them
    handed two of three dancers nearly the same blue.
